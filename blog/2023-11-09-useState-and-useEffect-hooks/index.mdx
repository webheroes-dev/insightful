There are many hooks that you will come across when working with React, each of which have a carefully designed purpose and intricacies.

Understanding `useState` and `useEffect`, two of the most fundamental hooks, is fundamental to carefully tracking the sate of a component.

## Why do we need state

Consider the simple case where we have a button which increments a counter upon being pressed.
Naively this may be implemented as

```tsx showLineNumbers
function NaiveButtonCounter() {
  let count = 0

  const incrementCounter = () => {
    console.log(`Pre-increment: ${count}`)
    count = count + 1;
    console.log(`Post-increment: ${count}`)
  }

  return (
      <>
        <button onClick={() => incrementCounter()}>Click me to increase counter!</button>
        <p>Times pressed: {count}</p>
      </>
  );
}
```

Looking into the console will show:

```console
Pre-increment: 0
Post-increment: 1
Pre-increment: 1
Post-increment: 2
Pre-increment: 2
Post-increment: 3
```

However, the screen will always show the text `Times pressed: 0`.
This is because the variable `count` is not a state, and hence the component is not rerendered when its value is updated.

## useState

The `useState` hook allows state to be added to functional components.
This state will be maintained between each render of the component, as well as causing rerender upon changing values.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useState } from "react";

function ButtonCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
  /*    ☝️
  *     Notice the destructuring assignment
  */

  const incrementCounter = () => {
    console.log(`Pre-increment: ${count}`)
    setCount(count + 1);
    console.log(`Post-increment: ${count}`)
  }

  return (
      <>
        <button onClick={() => incrementCounter()}>Click me to increase counter!</button>
        <p>Times pressed: {count}</p>
      </>
  );
}
```

Now looking into the console will show:

```console
Pre-increment: 0
Post-increment: 0
Pre-increment: 1
Post-increment: 1
Pre-increment: 2
Post-increment: 2
```

However, now the screen should update the value shown in the text `Times pressed: ${count}` to be the actual number of times the button has been pressed.

### When does rerendering happen

The rerendering of the component will only occur after the function it is called within is complete.
More specifically, the `setCount` call is batched and the value of the `count` state is only updated after the `incrementCount` function completes. Hence, the `console.log('Post-increment: ${count}')` appears to use the previous count value.

Once the state value is updated, the component is rerendered, executing the body of the function component again, and recreating the rendered HTML.
But the state is unaffected, hence the value of `count` is maintained, and the function reference `setCount` remains unchanged.

### Initialising the state

The `useState` method is generic, allowing for any valid type to be used.

There are two methods for initialising the state. Regardless of the approach, the state that is returned will be equal to the initial value.

The first approach is to provide the initial value directly to the `useState` hook call.
This is appropriate when the initial value is known, for example knowing the counter will start from 0.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import {useState} from "react";

function ButtonCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
  // ...
}
```

The alternative is to provide a function which takes no arguments and returns the initial value.
This is appropriate when the initial value must perform an intensive computation as this function is only called on the first render.

Taking this approach avoids the recomputation of the initial value after the first render as it will no longer be required.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import {useState} from "react";

function getInitialCount() {
  let count = 0;
  // Intensive computation
  return count
}

function ButtonCounter() {
  /* 💣 Do not do this */
  // const initialValue = getInitialCount()
  // const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(initialValue);

  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(() => getInitialCount());
  // ...
}
```

### setState

The useState hook returns an array that is two elements long, the first being the initial value, and the second being a function to set the state, e.g.

```ts
const [state: T, setState: (prev: T) => T] = useState<T>(initialValue: T | getInitialValue: () => T);
```

The `setState` function can be provided the value for the next state, or a function which takes the previous state and returns the next state.
This means the component can also be written.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { useState } from "react";

function ButtonCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);

  const incrementCounter = () => {
    console.log(`Pre-increment: ${count}`)
    setCount(c => c + 1);
    console.log(`Post-increment: ${count}`)
  }

  return (
      <>
        <button onClick={() => incrementCounter()}>Click me to increase counter!</button>
        <p>Times pressed: {count}</p>
      </>
  );
}
```
