Nowadays, no matter which framework we're using or if any at all, no matter if we're using TypeScript or not,
we're still writing JavaScript (kinda). There are many helpful features in recent ECMAScript versions that may
significantly improve both code readability and our efficiency. Let's jump into them!

<!--truncate-->

## String interpolation

**one of the core and most useful language features**

Consider adding a label containing some math:

```js showLineNumbers
const a = 1
const b = 2

const label = 'Sum of ' + a + ' and ' + b + ' is ' + a + b
// 💣 Sum of 1 and 2 is 12
```

This fails simply because both `a` and `b` are considered strings since we're concatenating along with string values.

We could fix it by wrapping math into parentheses:

```js showLineNumbers
const label = 'Sum of ' + a + ' and ' + b + ' is ' + (a + b)
// 👌 Sum of 1 and 2 is 3
```

It works, so it's great, we can move on.

But is there a better way?

There is! And the answer is _string interpolation_. The above working solution could be simply replaced with a much more readable expression:

```js showLineNumbers
const label = `Sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`
// ✨ Sum of 1 and 2 is 3
```

## Ternary operator

Also called conditional operator. Its purpose is to simplify some `if`-statement-based code allowing us to achieve the same in a single expression.

Let's define a goal for the exercise: to check if a value has been provided or not, applying a fancy label.

```js showLineNumbers
function describe(value) {
  if (!!value) {
    return 'Value provided'
  } else {
    return 'Busted! There is missing value'
  }
}

describe('something') // Value provided
describe() // ✨ Busted! There is missing value
```

It would be more complicated though when we would need to conditionally assign a value to a variable.

So how to get the label inline?

```js showLineNumbers
function describe(value) {
  // highlight-next-line
  const label = !!value ? 'present' : 'missing'
  return `Value is ${label}`
}

describe() // Value is missing
describe('something') // Value is present
```

## Equality check - strict vs weak

:::info

That's a quite important thing as it can reverse your code logic in some (if not most) cases.

:::

There are two ways of checking equality of things: a strict and a weak one.

Weak comparison used to be a subject of JS memes.

![JS non-intuitive double equals comparison](/img/js-eqeq-meme.png)

In short, it doesn't compare types and is discouraged most of the time.
We will create a helper function to see how it behaves in different scenarios (including one that proves weak comparison to be useful, stay tuned!).

```js showLineNumbers
function checkEquality(source, testValue) {
  const weakResult = source == testValue
  const strictResult = source === testValue

  return `
    ${source} == ${testValue} is ${weakResult}
    ${weakResult === strictResult ? 'and' : ', but'}
    ${source} === ${testValue} is ${strictResult}
  `
}
```

Starting with the obvious one:

```js showLineNumbers
checkEquality('a', 'b')
// "a" == "b" is false and "a" === "b" is false
```

Nothing shocking yet, let's continue:

```js showLineNumbers
checkEquality([], 0)
// [] == 0 is true , but [] === 0 is false
```

Ok, let's make a pause. `[]` is an empty array, but we wouldn't expect it to be equal to `0`, would we?

That's why weak comparison is discouraged. In fact, JS converts the values first in this case.

Think of the example as of an array that has `0` elements and simple `0` numeric value.
The result would be the same for a blank string, even containing white spaces:

```js showLineNumbers
checkEquality(' ', 0)
// " " == 0 is true , but " " === 0 is false
```

Ok, so I think we can agree now that, by default, we should use strict comparison (`===`).

There's a useful case though - nullish values

:::note

_Nullish_ value can be either `null` or `undefined`

:::

Sometimes we don't mind if something is `null` or `undefined` as long as it's not
e.g. an array, so we can push some elements into it, but only once it's defined.

With strict comparison we would be enforced to do similar things twice:

```js showLineNumbers
function getArray(value) {
  // highlight-next-line
  if (value === null || value === undefined) {
    return []
  } else {
    return value
  }
}
```

This can be simplified though, thanks to weak comparison against nullish values:

```js showLineNumbers
function getArray(value) {
  // highlight-next-line
  if (value == null) {
    return []
  } else {
    return value
  }
}


getArray() // []
getArray(["there's something!"]) // ["there's something!"]
```

## Destructuring assignment

Have you ever found this challenging to get some properties of an object, while ignoring the rest?
You surely have (or will soon 😉). We need to do so when doing various sorts of data mapping, usually related to network calls.

Imagine a config object that contains a bunch of properties like:

export const config = {
  appName: 'The App',
  env: 'DEV',
  api: 'https://example.whapp.dev/api/v2',
  oidc: {
  // ...
  },
}

```js
const config = {
  appName: 'The App',
  env: 'DEV',
  api: 'https://example.whapp.dev/api/v2',
  oidc: {
    // ...
  },
}
```

We were told to create an application header including the name and environment.

Of course, we could make it using property access:

```js showLineNumbers
  const label = `${config.appName} (${config.env})`
  // The App (DEV)
```

However, a destructed shape might be easier to use and more readable:

```js showLineNumbers
  // highlight-next-line
  const { appName, env } = config
  const label = `${appName} (${env})`
  // The App (DEV)
```

## Spread operator

### Array-like

Consider having two collections - for simplicity, arrays of numbers.

export const arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
export const arr2 = [7, 20]

How could we e.g. merge those into single one? First thought - with loops, obviously!
Let's give it a try.

```js showLineNumbers
function merge(a, b) {
  // highlight-start
  const result = []
  a.forEach((element) => {
    result.push(element)
  })
  // and here we go again 😩
  b.forEach((element) => {
    result.push(element)
  })
  // highlight-end

  return result
}

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
const arr2 = [7, 20]
merge(arr1, arr2) // [1, 2, 3, 7, 20]
```

Cool, it works. Though spread operator (`...`) is there to make this much simpler:

```js showLineNumbers
function merge(a, b) {
  // highlight-next-line
  const result = [...a, ...b] // ✨ that's neat, isn't it?
  return result
}

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
const arr2 = [7, 20]
merge(arr1, arr2) // [1, 2, 3, 7, 20]
```

It _spreads_ all the elements in place.

### Object properties

Hold on, that's not the end of the story yet - we can spread object properties as well.

Imagine a shape:

```js
const source = {
  id: '1234abcd',
  name: 'Here we are!',
  metadata: {
    something: 'irrelevant',
  },
}
```

export const source = {
  id: '1234abcd',
  name: 'Here we are!',
  metadata: {
    something: 'irrelevant',
  },
}

How to get most of the properties of an object but omit a few?
Till the object is not huge it would be pretty much straightforward to get what we need with explicit mapping.

```js showLineNumbers
const source = {
  id: '1234abcd',
  name: 'Here we are!',
  metadata: {
    something: 'irrelevant',
  },
}

const allButMetadata = {
  // highlight-start
  id: source.id,
  name: source.name
  // highlight-end
}
```

But how the code would look like if there were dozens of properties? It would be enormous spaghetti!

Here _spread operator (...)_ comes in handy once again:


```js showLineNumbers
const {
  metadata,
  // highlight-next-line
  ...allButMetadata
} = source
```

## Nullish coalescing operator

One of the common challenges with handling data is that something is missing, and we want to apply a default value.

JS got a nice thing a while ago to handle that - we can just use `someValue ?? defaultValue` expression.

```js showLineNumbers
function describe(value) {
  // highlight-next-line
  return value ?? 'I am not null anymore! 💪'
}

// highlight-next-line
describe(null) // I am not null anymore! 💪
describe('Such a thing') // Such a thing
```

:::note

In fact there's also logical OR operator `||` of which special case is the nullish coalescing one.

The difference is that logical OR will evaluate to the default value for any falsy value, including empty strings and...`0` number.
That may be handy in some cases, though mostly we need to ensure that the value is not nullish.

```js showLineNumbers
function describe(value) {
  // highlight-next-line
  return value || 'I was blank'
}

// highlight-next-line
describe('') // I was blank
describe('Such a thing') // Such a thing
```

:::

## Nullish coalescing assignment

Pretty similar to [nullish coalescing operator](#nullish-coalescing-operator) in its behavior but with a slightly different purpose.
It helps in property/variable initialization when it's nullish, to stop being so.

```js showLineNumbers
function fulfill(source) {
  // highlight-next-line
  source.js ??= 'rocks! 🪨'

  return source
}

fulfill({
  js: 'is nice'
})
/* {
  js: 'is nice'
} */

fulfill({
  thing: 'still here'
})
/* {
  thing: 'still here',
// highlight-next-line
  js: 'rocks! 🪨'
} */
```

## Lazy property assignment

Sometimes we need to assign a property to an object only in particular circumstances
while having `undefined` or `null` as a value is not an option. We can consider using [the spread operator](#spread-operator):

```js showLineNumbers
// styles.js
const styles = {
  box: {
    border: '1px solid #000'
  }
}
// index.js
const elementStyle = {
  ...styles.box, // ✓ `box` was defined as an object
  ...styles.card, // 💣 crashes, there's no `card` property at `styles`
}
```

So it doesn't work just like that. What else can we do? Using extra [ternary operator](#ternary-operator) is a common way to handle such issues.

```js showLineNumbers
const elementStyle = {
  ...styles.box, // ✓ `box` was defined as an object
// highlight-start
  ...(styles.card ? styles.card : {}),
  // 💪 doesn't crash anymore, even if there's no `card` property at `styles`
// highlight-end
}

/* {
  border: '1px solid #000'
} */
```

In fact, spread operator can take boolish values as well. Let's try this out:

```js showLineNumbers
const elementStyle = {
  ...styles.box, // ✓ `box` was defined as an object
// highlight-start
  ...(styles.card && styles.card),
  // 👌 doesn't crash anymore, even if there's no `card` property at `styles`
// highlight-end
}

/* {
  border: '1px solid #000'
} */
```

Cool, it's nice but there's a catch. Value wouldn't be assigned when falsy...

```js showLineNumbers
const disabled = false
const things = {
  here: 'we go'
}

const result = {
  ...things,
  // highlight-next-line
  ...(disabled && {disabled}) // 💣 `disabled` won't be assigned
}
/* {
  here: 'we go'
} */
```

Here's a thing - nothing stops us to compare the value with `undefined` (or anything else):

```js showLineNumbers
const disabled = false
const things = {
  here: 'we go'
}

const result = {
  ...things,
  // highlight-next-line
  ...(disabled !== undefined && {disabled}) // ✨ `disabled` will be assigned
}
/* {
  here: 'we go',
  disabled: false
} */
```

:::tip Did you know?

Within an object, there's a difference between property that has `undefined` value and a property that was not defined.

```js showLineNumbers
const someCollection = [1, 2, 3]
const source = {
  // highlight-start
  foo: someCollection[4]
  /*
     `someCollection[4]` evaluates to `undefined` since
     `someCollection` has only 3 elements
  */
  // highlight-end
}

// highlight-start
source.foo // undefined
source.bar // undefined
// highlight-end
```

Wait, I just said that these are different, right? Ok then...

```js showLineNumbers
Object.hasOwn(source, 'foo')
// true, we've defined `foo` to be `undefined`

// highlight-start
Object.hasOwn(source, 'bar')
// false, there's no `bar` property in source
// highlight-end
```

:::

## Optional chaining

I think we can agree that we're dealing with nullish values pretty often.
Usually we're trying to access a property on an object that doesn't really exist.

Sometimes we're reaching top level property to test against nullish values.
In such cases we could just write a simple if-statement and exit early.
But things used to be much more complicated than that.

Let's say we have a blob storage of documents in the cloud and many users have access to edit it while the first user is the initial creator.
We want to display information about the second contributor somewhere.

In the ideal world everything would be easy, and we'd have an accessor like this one:

```js showLineNumbers
const contributorName = file.metadata.contributors[1].fullName
//      💣 TypeError: undefined is not an object ☝️
```

Unfortunately, following contributors are not returned separately, but in a joint collection.

We've got a requirement from the Product Owner to display `-` in case there's only one contributor.

```js showLineNumbers
const contributorName = file.metadata.contributors[1]?.fullName ?? '-'
//       ✨ One character that makes the difference ☝️
```

It's pretty neat when used along with [nullish coalescing operator](#nullish-coalescing-operator)

## `in` operator

Sometimes we need to check if there's a particular property in an object.

Assume we're dealing with an object that has either `stringValue` or `numberValue`, never both.
What's worse, these values could be `undefined` or `null`.

How to tell which case we're dealing with?

By checking if such object has a particular property:

```js showLineNumbers
const source = {
  numberValue: undefined
}
// highlight-next-line
if (`stringValue` in source) {
  /* `source.stringValue` is there,
      but we don't know/mind if it's non-blank string or nullish value
   */
} else {
  /* `source.stringValue` isn't there,
      so we may assume we need to use `source.numberValue`
   */
}
```

## Comma expression

Last but not least.
It's rarely used in repositories, although it could be present in local code that has not been pushed yet.

Comma expressions does everything from left to right but returns only the last part.

It's like in a CSV file we would return the last column.

```js showLineNumbers
let x = 1;

/*        these are executed but not assigned to `y`
            👇 👇         */
const y = (++x, x++, ++x);
/*                    ☝️
*             `y` will be 4
*/
```

That probably wasn't the best use case, but keeping in mind how it behaves, you could easily debug things inline:

```js showLineNumbers title="spaghetti-code.js"
- (value) => mutateValue(value, globalThing)
+ (value) => mutateValue(
  // highlight-start
+   (console.debug('[DEBUG] The Value:', value),
+   (console.debug('[DEBUG] Global thing:', globalThing)
  // highlight-end
+ ) // ✨ Logs both `value` and `globalThing`, separately
```
