Here we go (with description)

## What's TypeScript?

- strongly typed programming language
- brings type safety to JS world
- works at build time - all types are removed once code is compiled into JS

## A few ways to say the shape

### Type declaration

- with use of colons
```ts showLineNumbers
const label: string = 'Here we go'
```
- return type of functions
```ts showLineNumbers
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b
}
```
- `satisfies` operator
  - starting from TS 4.9
  - doesn't change type but ensures the value _satisfies_ the type

### Type inference

- TS can infer what's the shape of variable
    ```ts showLineNumbers
    const label = 'Here we go again'
    // ✨  ☝️string
    ```
- TS can infer return type of a function
    ```ts showLineNumbers
    function measure(thing: string) {
        return thing.length // ✨ number
    }
    ```

### Define the type

- `interface`
    ```ts showLineNumbers
    interface Thing {
        label: string
        value: unknown
    }
    ```
- `type`
    ```ts showLineNumbers
    type Thing = {
        label: string
        value: unknown
    }
    ```
    - regards official docs, could be slower than `interface`
    - can describe `union` of types
    ```ts showLineNumbers
    type Value = string | number
    ```

## Easy way for self-defeat

- `any` usually makes TS useless - TS becomes JS since value can be `any`thing
- better to use `unknown` which doesn't allow to treat value as anything (need to ensure the type first)

## Final notes/recommendations

- personally
  - variables: let TS infer primitives
  - variables: use `satisfies` if possible or declare object-like
  - function return type: let TS infer by default
    - rarely declare return type when complex constraints are required
  - when appropriate, cast `as const` to narrow the type, usually just string literals
- don't use `any` till really necessary (prefer `unknown`)
