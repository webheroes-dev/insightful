- using TypeScript itselt introduces some degree of safety to your codebase
- we can easily boost TypeScript safety even more

<!--truncate-->

:::tip Remember

- TypeScript works at build time only
- all types are removed when code is compiled to JS

:::

:::note

Consider the following example:
- status is either `'ok'` or `'error'`
- if ok, `data` is a list of strings
- in case of an error, `error` is a message.

:::

## Narrow to literals

Let's define a simple variable:


```ts showLineNumbers
const result = {
    status: 'ok', // string
    data: ['here we go'] // string[]
}
// ...
if (result.status === 'error') {
    // ...
}
```

At first glance everything looks fine, no error is thrown.

```ts showLineNumbers
if (result.status === 'error') {
    // ðŸ¥´ We should never be here since `status` was 'ok',
    // the condition doesn't make sense, but it will pass compilation
}
```

Let's see how it behaves if we use `as const` cast to define a literal type string.

```ts showLineNumbers
const saferResult = {
    // highlight-next-line
    status: 'ok' as const, // âœ¨ 'ok'
    data: ['here we go again'] // string[]
}
// highlight-start
if (saferResult.status === 'error') {
    // âœ¨ TS will complain since 'error' could not be 'ok',
    // compilation fails, we are safe
}
// highlight-end
```
Using literal types is extremely useful, when we precisely know the values of a variable.

Narrowing the range of possible values may seem quite non-intuitive, but it actually has many advantages.
By removing the parts of code that would never actually impact the application in any way, we:
- significantly improve the quality of our code,
- we improve the developer experience for others that will later on work on our code,
- we make the application lighter - removing a single unnecessary position from your code may seem to be irrelevant, but when we're talking about multiple lines in a massive application - it might considerably improve your app's performance.

## Union types

With union types, you specify the possible values of a type. It's up to you how many values the type can have.
In the following example, we define a primitive type, Status:


```ts showLineNumbers
type Status = 'ok' | 'error'
```

Unions can be much more complex and have various shapes. In the following example, we're creating a new type based on a union of two different types.

```ts showLineNumbers
type Person = {
    id: string
    name: string
    email: string
}
type Company = {
    id: number
    name: string
    phoneNumber: string
}

type Entity = Person | Company

/*
type Entity = {
// highlight-next-line
    id: string | number
    name: string
}
*/
}
```
Elements that are absent in both Person and Company (`email`, `phoneNumber`) are removed when we're using union.
Properties that are defined in the same way (`name`), remain unchanged in our result (the union of string | string is string).
In case of `id`, because it was present in both types, but with different values, the result is a union of both types.

## Discriminated union

If a property exists only in specific circumstances, we can verify its value using a discriminator.
The type is then resolved to a member of this union.

We usually let TS infer the function conditional return type. However, it might not work, when return type depends on input value (which means that it's known at build time).


```ts showLineNumbers
type Response = {
    // highlight-start
    status: 'ok'
    data: string[]
    // highlight-end
} | {
    // highlight-start
    status: 'error'
    error: string
    // highlight-end
}

function makeTheCall(): Response {
  // ...
}

const response = makeTheCall()

if (response.status === 'ok') {
    console.log(response.data)
} else {
    console.error(response.error)
}
```

The main advantage of such strong typing, is that our code is much more simple.
We don't need to additionally check if the data or error property is in the variable.


## Infer return type

Consider the following function that returns an HTTP call response:

```ts showLineNumbers
function makeTheCall() {
    let ok: boolean
    let results: string[]
    let error: string
    // ... do the stuff ...
    if (ok) {
        // highlight-start
        return {
            status: 'ok',
            data: results
        }
        // highlight-end
    } else {
        // highlight-start
        return {
            status: 'error',
            message: error
        }
        // highlight-end
    }
}

/* {
// highlight-start
    status: string
    data?: string[] | undefined
    message?: string | undefined
// highlight-end
} */
```
Return type of the function is weakly inferred, since both `'ok'` and `'error'` are considered to be `string`s.

In order to fix it, cast `as const`.
It makes the union much more safe, but TS is still inferring types.
Simple strings are then considered constant values - however, if something was declared as a string beforehand, it would still be considered a string.

```ts showLineNumbers
function makeTheCall() {
    let ok: boolean
    let results: string[]
    let error: string
    // ... do the stuff ...
    if (ok) {
        return {
            status: 'ok',
            data: results
// highlight-next-line
        } as const // âœ¨
    } else {
        return {
            status: 'error',
            message: error
// highlight-next-line
        } as const // âœ¨
    }
}

// highlight-start
/* {
    status: 'ok'
    data: string[]
} | {
    status: 'error'
    message: string
} */
// highlight-end
```

TypeScript will unite all returns if there is more than one. Usually, TS would infer the type itself.


Having cast both returns `as const`, we can now safely work with the status.

```ts showLineNumbers
const response = makeTheCall()

// highlight-next-line
if (response.status === 'ok') {
    console.log(response.data)
} else {
    console.error(response.error)
}
```

Here are some crucial benefits of casting return types:
- we don't have to specify types,
- TS will infer the types, which is highly recommended.


## Generic types

- useful when we don't mind about what's the shape of function argument

```ts showLineNumbers
// highlight-next-line
function map<Input>(input: Input) {

    return {
        data: input
    }
}

// highlight-start
map('this') // âœ¨ { data: string }
map([0, 1, 10]) // âœ¨ { data: number[] }
// highlight-end
```

- generics are much more powerful than that

## Return type

The `ReturnType` utility type is a generic type that helps us easily define the type returned by a function. The typeof operator infers the shape of an object.
We can infer the types of variables, that can be then saved for later use in the application.


:::tip Did you know?

In the context of types, `typeof` operator will infer the shape of something that has already been defined.

```ts showLineNumbers
const label = 'here we go'
type Label = typeof label // âœ¨ string

const response = {
    status: 'ok' as const,
    data: ['here we go again']
}
type Response = typeof response
/* âœ¨ {
    status: 'ok'
    data: string[]
} */
```

:::

```ts showLineNumbers
type Response = ReturnType<typeof makeTheCall>

// highlight-start
/* {
    status: 'ok'
    data: string[]
} | {
    status: 'error'
    message: string
} */
// highlight-end
```
