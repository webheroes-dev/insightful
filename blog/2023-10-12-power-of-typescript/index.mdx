## What's TypeScript?

- [ ] strongly typed programming language
- [ ] brings type safety to JS world
- [ ] works at build time - all types are removed once code is compiled into JS

## A few ways to say the shape

### Type declaration

- [ ] with use of colons
```ts showLineNumbers
const label: string = 'Here we go'
```
- [ ] return type of functions
```ts showLineNumbers
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b
}
```

### Type inference

- [ ] TS can infer what's the shape of variable
- [ ]

```ts showLineNumbers
const label = 'Here we go again'
// ✨  ☝️string
```
